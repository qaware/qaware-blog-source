## This is Software EKG - COVID-19 Edition

Software EKG is a powerful tool for time series analysis developed by QAware. Utilizing a highly efficient search index and optimized algorithms, the tool enables you to both visualize and analyze time series containing billions of values.

Our special *COVID-19 Edition* provides you with the latest data on COVID-19 from all countries *worldwide*. Not only can you get a detailed overview of the Coronavirus pandemic in a single country, it is also possible to compare different countries with each other using a plethora of metrics like positive test rate, population density or even hospital beds available.

## Why time series analysis is essential

When analyzing the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic, considering only absolute numbers will not suffice. Instead, it is crucial to take the dimension of time into account. Thus, time series analysis is the key to fully understand current trends and developments regarding COVID-19 and to detect important correlations between metrics (See, for example, the correlation between new death cases (black) and postitive test rate (red) in Germany in the graph below).
